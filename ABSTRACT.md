# IFX / KQR  
## Governance for Knowledge in Non-Deterministic Systems

---

## Abstract

Non-deterministic systems such as Large Language Models
produce outputs that are probabilistic by nature.

Fluency and plausibility are often mistaken for knowledge,
leading to unqualified adoption in decision contexts.

This document introduces the IFX/KQR framework,
a governance-oriented approach to distinguishing
between plausible output and admissible knowledge.

## The Problem of Admissibility

In deterministic systems, correctness can be verified.

In non-deterministic systems:
- outputs cannot be assumed correct
- repetition does not imply reliability
- confidence is not evidence

A missing layer exists between inference and decision-making:
**knowledge qualification**.

---

## KQR — Knowledge Qualification Regime

KQR defines the rules under which an output can be treated
as admissible knowledge.

It specifies:
- qualification criteria
- admissibility boundaries
- explicit uncertainty handling
- rejection conditions

KQR is a **governance regime**, not an execution mechanism.

## IFX — Inference Forensics Execution

IFX is the execution and enforcement layer
that applies KQR rules at runtime.

IFX provides:
- enforcement of qualification policies
- traceability of inference paths
- forensic guarantees
- auditability of AI-assisted decisions

IFX ensures that unqualified outputs
cannot silently propagate.

## Why IFX/KQR Matters

Without governance:
- models hallucinate
- organizations adopt false certainty
- accountability dissolves

With IFX/KQR:
- outputs are bounded
- uncertainty is explicit
- trust becomes systemic, not probabilistic

---

## Conclusion

In non-deterministic systems,
trust is not a property of the model.

It is a property of the **governance that surrounds it**.
