# Why IFX and KQR Exist

> *Organizations will not be judged on whether they used AI. They will be judged on whether they knew what they were doing with its outputs.*

---

Non-deterministic systems made output generation easy.

They made knowledge legitimacy unclear.

**KQR** defines when an output may be treated as admissible knowledge.

**IFX** enforces that decision with traceability, auditability, and explicit limits.

---

## The Problem

| Before | Now |
|--------|-----|
| Deterministic systems | Non-deterministic systems |
| Process validation = output legitimacy | Process validation ≠ output legitimacy |
| Reproducibility implied reliability | Same input ≠ same output |
| Audit focused on process | Audit must focus on epistemic status |

Organizations are embedding AI outputs into decisions, products, and workflows.

Most have no framework to answer: *"On what basis was this treated as valid knowledge?"*

## What We Built

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **KQR** | Governance regime — defines admissibility rules |
| **IFX** | Forensic enforcement layer — applies rules at runtime |

Neither generates AI outputs.

Neither promises truth.

Both provide: **control, audit, defensibility.**

## What This Enables

| Capability | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| Explicit qualification | Know what kind of output you have |
| Usage constraints | Know what you can do with it |
| Forensic audit trail | Prove why it was used |
| Risk containment | Limit blast radius of errors |

## Target Environments

- Healthcare
- Public administration
- Legal
- Finance
- Enterprise AI governance

Any environment where errors are not acceptable.

---

## What This Is NOT

- An AI product
- A truth-verification system
- An automation engine
- A prompt engineering framework

---

## Position

We do not make AI outputs correct.

We make organizations accountable for knowing what those outputs are.

Any environment where decisions must remain defensible under audit.
